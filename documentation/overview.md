## Creating a standup

To create a standup, I must be in a channel - you can invite me with
`/invite @{{bot_name}}`.  Then, in that channel, say:

```
@{{bot_name}} create standup <time> [days]
```

The time is required and will be assumed to be in the
{{timezone}} timezone.  Days are optional - if omitted, the standup will
run every weekday.  If provided, days should be separated by spaces.  For
example:

```
@{{bot_name}} create standup 10:30am Monday Wednesday Friday
```

* To create a reminder for a standup, you can just tell me `@{{bot_name}} reminder <minutes before standup>`
* By default, I don't use any @-notices when posting the standup reminder, but you can set an audience that should be notified by saying `@{{bot_name}} audience <target>`. The target can be `@here`, `@channel`, `@<user-group>`, etc.
* To remove an existing standup, message me from the channel where the standup is currently scheduled with `@{{bot_name}} remove standup`

## Submitting your standup

If I'm configured to send a reminder, you can just add an emoji
`reaction` to my reminder message (or any of my other messages) and I
will start an interview with you via DM.  You can also DM me just
the channel name to start the interview.

You can also send me your standup in a single message by sending me
a DM like this:

```
#channel-name
y: what you did yesterday
t: what you did today
b: what's in your way (blockers)
```

## All commands

All of the following commands can only be invoked by mentioning the standup bot in a channel.  Unless specified otherwise, they will not work via a direct message to the standup bot.

* `help` or `usage` - Get the usage information for the standup bot.  Works in a direct message or by mentioning the bot in a channel.

### Standup interview/report related
* `interview` OR *Add an emoji reaction to a message from the standup bot in a channel* - Tell the standup bot to start an interview with you for the current channel.  The standup bot will start the interview in a direct messsage.

* `report [channel] [user] [days]` - Valid in channel or direct mention.  Show the user-specific standup report for today for the current channel for the current user by default.  If a different channel or user mention is supplied, those will be used instead.   e.g. `report` (today, current channel, current user), `report 2` (today and yesterday, current channel, current user), `report #testroom @userA 3` (past 3 days for in testroom for userA),...
* `ooo (days)` - Specify that the user will be out of the office for the specified number of calendar days (not business days or standup-only days).  e.g. `ooo for 7 days` (out for the next week), `out of the office 5` (our for next 5 calendar days)


### Scheduling Related

If days are not specified, Monday-Friday are assumed.  e.g. `create standup 10:00am` (create standup for 10:00am M-F), `schedule standup 13:00 M Th F` (1:00 PM Monday, Thursday, and Friday), `move standup 9:00 Wednesday` (9:00am Wednesday)
*  `remind[er] XX` - Have the standup bot message the current channel `XX` minutes before the standup will be reported to remind people that they need to submit a standup report.  No mentions are used in the reminder message unless specified in the `audience` command.  e.g. `remind 5`, `reminder 30`.
